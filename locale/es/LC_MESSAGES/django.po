"The Blair Band and Orchestra Patrons is the booster organization that "
"supports Montgomery Blair High School’s Instrumental Music Program. We "
"created the Community Festival Series (Carnival of the Animals and Peter and "
"the Wolf) in part as a fundraiser, but also so our teens could share their "
"love of music with the next generation of possible musicians. Many of our "
"teens were introduced to music through events like these and we are so very "
"happy to give them a way to pay it forward! We all remember what it’s like "
"to parent young children and we hope we have created an an affordable day "
"that brings joy to you and your children."
